This is the Seattle metro area,and consists of the region bound by the puget sound and lake washington. This is one of the most picturesque cities in the world and boasts of beautiful views (when it is not raining that is!). Seattle is my preferred region because I have lived here for for 7 years and though I moved to a suburb of Seattle, I still commute into the city for work. Seattle is both a tech and tourism hub and has exploded in terms of human and infrastructure developments in the last decade.
